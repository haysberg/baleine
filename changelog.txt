------
- Now using Tokio Tracing for log management
- Fixed a bug where the terminal would get broken when multiple machines were deployed
- Now using the openssh crate for managing machine instead of spawning a local process which speeds up deployment
- Way better handling of errors during deployment, giving more information when something fails
- Trimmed down the number of used libraries
- Added warnings when using default values when config file is not found
- Formatted the logs so that they are easier to read
