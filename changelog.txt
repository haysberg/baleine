0.4.1
------

- Fixed a bug where the command sent to the Docker daemon was not between double quotes, causing it to ignore all arguments after the first one. (for example : ls -al would be considered as just ls)
- Removed problematic options in the command parser for the "deploy" subcommand : You now HAVE to put the values for the "--command" and "--options" arguments between quotes.
- Added a "-f" short flag alias and a "--force" alias for the "--yes" option in the destroy subcommand
- Fixed a bug where double quotes were added to the command even when no command was provided, overriding the default Docker entrypoint.
- Added a "docker pull" command before deploy so that if you need the latest image, you'll get it.
