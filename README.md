# Baleine üêã
Orchestrate Docker containers over the R2Lab platform from a single CLI.

Using the four subcommands of this tool, you can deploy Docker containers on top of the 37 test nodes available in R2Lab.
- `deploy` to automatically deploy containers on the specified nodes with the Docker options you want
- `destroy` to remove the containers
- `save` to save a running container as a new image on the local R2Lab repository
- `list` to get a list of all the images on the repository

Other benefits :
- By using a local repository, we can cache the image downloaded from external sources, allowing for much faster deployment.
- The code is fully multi-threaded, allowing for good scalability.
- The project is completely open-source and all the libraries are contained within the binary, which makes it extremely portable.
- Using Docker containers, we can save, deploy and destroy an instance in mere seconds.
- Thanks to the nature of Docker containers, our experiments can be easily reproduced without having to fiddle with config files.
